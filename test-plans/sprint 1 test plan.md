Test Plan

for the

Architectural Prototype

1. Objectives

1.1 Purpose

    This document describes the plan for testing the architectural prototype of the C-Registration System. This Test Plan document supports the following objectives:

        Identify existing project information and the software that should be tested.
        List the recommended test requirements (high level).
        Recommend and describe the testing strategies to be employed.
        Identify the required resources and provide an estimate of the test efforts.
        List the deliverable elements of the test activities.

1.2 Scope

    This Test Plan describes the integration and system tests that will be conducted on the architectural prototype following integration of the subsystems and components identified in the Integration Build Plan for the Prototype [16].

    It is assumed that unit testing already provided thorough black box testing, extensive coverage of source code, and testing of all module interfaces.

    The purpose of assembling the architectural prototype was to test feasibility and performance of the selected architecture. It is critical that all system and subsystem interfaces be tested as well as system performance at this early stage. Testing of system functionality and features will not be conducted on the prototype.

    The interfaces between the following subsystems will be tested:

        Course Registration
        Finance System
        Course Catalog.

    The external interfaces to the following devices will be tested:

        Local PCs
        Remote PCs.

    The most critical performance measures to test are:

        Response time for remote login to the course registration system.
        Response time to access the Finance System.
        Response time to access the Course Catalog Subsystem.
        Student response time when system loaded with 200 logged in students.
        Student response time when 50 simultaneous accesses to the Course Catalog database.

3.    Test Strategy

    The Test Strategy presents the recommended approach to the testing of the software applications. The previous section on Test Requirements described what will be tested; this describes how it will be tested.

    The main considerations for the test strategy are the techniques to be used and the criterion for knowing when the testing is completed.

    In addition to the considerations provided for each test below, testing should only be executed using known, controlled databases, in secured environments.

    The following test strategy is generic in nature and is meant to apply to the requirements listed in Section 4 of this document. 

    3.1 Testing Types

    3.1.1 Data and Database Integrity Testing

        The databases and the database processes should be tested as separate systems. These systems should be tested without the applications (as the interface to the data). Additional research into the DBMS needs to be performed to identify the tools / techniques that may exist to support the testing identified below.

 
Test Objective: 	Ensure Database access methods and processes function properly and without data corruption.
Technique: 	

    Invoke each database access method and process, seeding each with valid and invalid data (or requests for data).
    Inspect the database to ensure the data has been populated as intended, all database events occurred properly, or review the returned data to ensure that the correct data was retrieved (for the correct reasons)

Completion Criteria: 	All database access methods and processes function as designed and without any data corruption.
Special Considerations: 	

    Testing may require a DBMS development environment or drivers to enter or modify data directly in the databases.
    Processes should be invoked manually.
    Small or minimally sized databases (limited number of records) should be used to increase the visibility of any non-acceptable events.

 

 

    3.1.2 Function Testing

        Testing of the application should focus on any target requirements that can be traced directly to use cases (or business functions), and business rules. The goals of these tests are to verify proper data acceptance, processing, and retrieval, and the appropriate implementation of the business rules. This type of testing is based upon black box techniques, that is, verifying the application (and its internal processes) by interacting with the application via the GUI and analyzing the output (results). Identified below is an outline of the testing recommended for each application:

 
Test Objective: 	Ensure proper application navigation, data entry, processing, and retrieval.
Technique: 	

    Execute each use case, use case flow, or function, using valid and invalid data, to verify the following:
    The expected results occur when valid data is used.
    The appropriate error / warning messages are displayed when invalid data is used.
    Each business rule is properly applied.

Completion Criteria: 	

    All planned tests have been executed.
    All identified defects have been addressed.

Special Considerations: 	

    Access to the Wylie College UNIX Server and the existing Course Catalog System and Billing System is required to run some of the identified System Tests on the Prototype.

     

    3.1.3 Business Cycle Testing

        This section is not applicable to test of the architectural prototype.

    3.1.4 User Interface Testing

        User Interface testing verifies a userâ€™s interaction with the software. The goal of UI Testing is to ensure that the User Interface provides the user with the appropriate access and navigation through the functions of the applications. In addition, UI Testing ensures that the objects within the UI function as expected and conform to corporate or industry standards.

 
Test Objective: 	Verify the following:

    Navigation through the application properly reflects business functions and requirements, including window to window, field to field, and use of access methods (tab keys, mouse movements, accelerator keys)
    Window objects and characteristics, such as menus, size, position, state, and focus conform to standards.

Technique: 	

    Create / modify tests for each window to verify proper navigation and object states for each application window and objects.

Completion Criteria: 	Each window successfully verified to remain consistent with benchmark version or within acceptable standard
Special Considerations: 	

    Not all properties for custom and third party objects can be accessed.

 

    3.1.5 Performance Profiling

        Performance testing measures response times, transaction rates, and other time sensitive requirements. The goal of Performance testing is to verify and validate the performance requirements have been achieved. Performance testing is usually executed several times, each using a different "background load" on the system. The initial test should be performed with a "nominal" load, similar to the normal load experienced (or anticipated) on the target system. A second performance test is run using a peak load.

        Additionally, Performance tests can be used to profile and tune a systemâ€™s performance as a function of conditions such as workload or hardware configurations.

        NOTE: Transactions below refer to "logical business transactions." These transactions are defined as specific functions that an end user of the system is expected to perform using the application, such as add or modify a given contract.

 
Test Objective: 	Validate System Response time for designated transactions or business functions under a the following two conditions:

- normal anticipated volume

- anticipated worse case volume
Technique: 	

    Use Test Scripts developed for Business Model Testing (System Testing).
    Modify data files (to increase the number of transactions) or modify scripts to increase the number of iterations each transaction occurs.
    Scripts should be run on one machine (best case to benchmark single user, single transaction) and be repeated with multiple clients (virtual or actual, see special considerations below).

Completion Criteria: 	

    Single Transaction / single user: Successful completion of the test scripts without any failures and within the expected / required time allocation (per transaction)
    Multiple transactions / multiple users: Successful completion of the test scripts without any failures and within acceptable time allocation.

Special considerations: 	

    Comprehensive performance testing includes having a "background" load on the server. There are several methods that can be used to perform this, including:
        "Drive transactions" directly to the server, usually in the form of SQL calls.
        Create "virtual" user load to simulate many (usually several hundred) clients. Remote Terminal Emulation tools are used to accomplish this load. This technique can also be used to load the network with "traffic."
        Use multiple physical clients, each running test scripts to place a load on the system.
    Performance testing should be performed on a dedicated machine or at a dedicated time. This permits full control and accurate measurement.
    The databases used for Performance testing should be either actual size, or scaled equally.

 

    3.1.6 Load Testing

        Load testing measures subjects the system-under-test to varying workloads to evaluate the systemâ€™s ability to continue to function properly under these different workloads. The goal of load testing is to determine and ensure that the system functions properly beyond the expected maximum workload. Additionally, load testing evaluates the performance characteristics (response times, transaction rates, and other time sensitive issues).

        NOTE: Transactions below refer to "logical business transactions." These transactions are defined as specific functions that an end user of the system is expected to perform using the application, such as add or modify a given contract.
